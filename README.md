Summer of Tech full stack JavaScript Masterclass

# Introduction

Welcome üñêÔ∏èüñêÔ∏èüñêÔ∏è

In this JavaScript Masterclass we'll be looking at the full development lifecycle of a website - Back end and front end, from creation to production deployment.

The goal of the session will be to give you a simple boilerplate portfolio website.

Topics we'll cover:

* Write a small **serverless** Node API
* Write a simple front end with React
* Deploy our website to the web using ZEIT

## Prerequisites / Install

Don't worry about cloning this repo - we're making everything from scratch today.

* A basic understanding of JavaScript
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
* An editor of your choice ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is great)
* [ZEIT CLI](https://zeit.co/download) installed
* A ZEIT account (free)
* Logged into your ZEIT cli
    * `$ now login`

# What does "full stack" mean?
"Full stack" is one of those weird terms that means different things to different people/companies.

Generally "full stack" developers are knowledgeable across all of the layers of development.

[This good article](https://medium.com/coderbyte/a-guide-to-becoming-a-full-stack-developer-in-2017-5c3c08a1600c) describes a modern full stack web developer as knowing:
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* Back-End Language
* Databases & Web Storage
* Devops & Cloud Computing
* HTTP & REST
* Web Application Architecture
* Git
* Basic Algorithms & Data Structures

Sounds like a lot.. But if we break it down, it's a little less scary. We'll try do that today!

# Project setup

Before we kick into writing code, let's start with one of the most important layers - our **Web Application Architecture**

* Node backend with a **serverless** web server
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) front end

We'll use `create-react-app` to generate the boilerplate of our project. This will give us everything we need to get cracking straight away.

```
npx create-react-app my-portfolio
```

Change directory into the folder that was just created:

```
cd my-portfolio
```

Looking in this folder, we have a functioning website!

The `package.json` file is located in the `root` of our folder and the files we edit are located in `src`.

Spin it up with:
```
npm start
```

Wait for it to build, then head over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see your website!

# Deploying

ZEIT now makes it incredibly easy to deploy our `create-react-app` project. It identifies that it's a react project, then does all the build and deploy steps for us.

Make sure you're logged in:
```
now login
```

Then deploy! (make sure you're in the project `root`)
```
now
```

Easy! This takes a moment, but will give you a link to the ZEIT site to check the progress and visit the site.

# Serverless applications

Serverless APIs are the cool new thang everyone is talking about. They don't use a traditional web server to send requests, instead you write **functions** which the platform executes for you.

Today we're using ZEIT as that platform, only because it's the easiest to use, but there are many out there that do this.

* [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
* [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/)
* [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/)

## Advantages of Serverless

1. Easy to deploy 
    * Just write and deploy your functions!
2. Low cost
    * No server to maintain, only runs when it's called
3. Better Scalability
    * Platform handles all the load for you

Traditional Node API:
```
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'))

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`))
```

Serverless API:
```
module.exports = (req, res) => {
    res.send('hello world);
}
```

Everything is just a **function**, which is run by the platform when it's needed.


# Now Develop
Our application is alive and deployed, but what about local development, so we don't have to deploy every time we want to make a change.

`now` comes with a handy dev mode, but to use that we first must add a script in our `package.json` file:
```
...
"scripts": {
    "dev": "react-scripts start --port $PORT",
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
...
```
Then when we run `now dev`, it will first spin up our "serverless" environment, then the React app. All changes will be instantly refreshed!

# API
Let's make our API. `now` expects all API's to come from a folder called `api`. In the root directory, create a new folder called that.

Then, in this folder, we'll create our JavaScript file which holds our **function**.

**The name of this file is important.** It's the route that we'll access our REST endpoint from. e.g. `projects.js` will be accessed from `http://my-now-url/api/projects`.

Create a file called `projects.js` inside the `api` folder.

Inside this file, put:
```
module.exports = (req, res) => {
    let projectsData = [
        {
            name: 'BNZ',
            html_url: 'http://bnz.co.nz',
            description: 'Banks aren\'t boring'
        }
    ];

    res.json(projectsData);    
}
```
Feel free to change the `name`, `html_url`, and `description` parts yourself to something you'd like.

This is just dummy data - we'll fetch our real data soon.

If you're not already running the dev server, run:
```
now dev
```

After the project has built, head to [http://localhost:3000/api/projects](http://localhost:3000/api/projects) to see the response from the api we just created.

## Add some real data
It would be nice if we could add in some live data about our projects from github.

The github api is really easy to use, some endpoints don't even require auth üòç

The endpoint we're interested in today is to list all of our projects.

`https://api.github.com/users/<your github user name>/repos`

E.g. https://api.github.com/users/marcusklein/repos returns all my projects and a bit of data about them.

In `index.js` with our express app, we can get the data we need from github using `node-fetch` (fetch is browser only).

```
npm i node-fetch
```

Then back in our `projects.json` file, replace the contents with:
```
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const githubRepoUrl = 'https://api.github.com/users/marcusklein/repos';

module.exports = (req, res) => {
    fetch(githubRepoUrl)
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(projects => {

            const gitHubProjects = projects.map(project => {
                return {
                    name: project.name,
                    html_url: project.html_url,
                    description: project.description
                }
            });

            res.json(gitHubProjects);    
        });
}
```

Save, wait for the app to rebuild, then you should see your projects returned!

That's all we need to do for our API.

# Front End
We've got some data from our API, now let's display it on our React webpage.

Head into the `src` folder, from your `root` directory. This is where the heart of your React website lives.

The `App.js` file is the one controling the page we can see on our website, so this is the one that we'll be editing.

Now, replace `src/App.js` with:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
    // Initialize state
    state = { projects: [] };

    // On load
    componentDidMount() {
        this.getProjects();
    }

    // Set state with our projects
    getProjects = () => {
        fetch('/api/projects')
            .then(res => res.json())
            .then(projects => this.setState({projects}));
    }

    render() {
        const { projects } = this.state;

        return (
            <div className="App">

                <h1>Hi, my name is YOUR NAME</h1>
                <h3>I'm a developer</h3>

                <h4>Here are a few of my projects</h4>

                {
                    projects.length ? (
                        projects.map((project, index) => (
                            <div key={project.name}>
                                <p><b><a href={project.html_url}>{project.name}</a></b></p>
                                <p>{project.description}</p>
                            </div>
                        ))
                    ) : (
                        <div>
                            I don't have any projects
                        </div>
                    )
                }
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default App;
```

If you don't quite understand what's going on, don't worry! A few [React tutorials](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) will be all you need.

Essentially, we're using `fetch` to access our api we created earlier, grab the project data, then looping over our projects and displaying them.

### Check out your site
Run your dev server again, and check out your site!
You should see all your projects list from your API.

## Component Libraries

Styling websites isn't easy, but thankfully we don't always have to start from scratch. Using **Component Libraries** we can easilly make our website look beautiful with only a few lines of code.

We'll be using the [Material-Ui](https://material-ui.com/) for this. It's one of the best out there, also one of the most used.

Install it:
```
npm install @material-ui/core
```

Load the default Roboto font in the `public/index.html` file. Put it above the `<title>`.

```
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap" />

```

Then back in your `src/App.js`

We'll import the Button component:
```
import Button from '@material-ui/core/Button';
```

Then replace our links with the Button components:
```
<Button 
    variant="contained"
    href={project.html_url}>
    {project.name}
</Button>
```

Now with a refresh we should see better buttons.

Component libaries are great. Have a play with Material-iu's components and style up your website.

# Deploy live again
Let's publish our final version!

```
now
```

After it's built, we should see our app live, using our own API we've built.

# Where to next?

Employers LOVE seeing the work you've done. Showing them that you have a rough idea of the process of shipping code goes a long way in an interview. Feel free to use this demo as a rough boilerplate in creating a portfolio you're proud of.
